    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>
        Thank you for using the <strong>ArcGIS Item Dependency Viewer</strong> Chrome extension. Your privacy is important to us, and this policy explains how we handle your data.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p>
        This extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data. All operations, including fetching ArcGIS item details and dependencies, are performed locally in your browser.
    </p>

    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <p>
        The extension requires the following permissions to function:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Active Tab:</strong> To interact with the currently open ArcGIS Online or Portal page.</li>
        <li><strong>Scripting:</strong> To inject scripts for fetching item details and dependencies.</li>
        <li><strong>Storage:</strong> To save user preferences and settings locally in your browser.</li>
        <li><strong>Identity:</strong> To enable OAuth login for accessing private ArcGIS items securely.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        The extension interacts with ArcGIS Online and ArcGIS Enterprise portals to fetch item details and dependencies. These interactions are performed directly between your browser and the ArcGIS servers, and no data is sent to any third-party servers.
    </p>

    <h2>Local Storage</h2>
    <p>
        User preferences, such as settings for hiding dependencies of the same type, are stored locally in your browser using Chrome's storage API. This data is not shared or transmitted outside your device.
    </p>

    <h2>OAuth Authentication</h2>
    <p>
        If you log in using OAuth to access private ArcGIS items, the authentication process is handled securely by ArcGIS servers. The extension does not store or transmit your credentials.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
        This privacy policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page. Please review this page periodically for updates.
    </p>
